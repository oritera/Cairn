# Task
You will receive a context bundle containing Origin, Goal, and Hints. You need to understand your starting point and the information already available (Origin and Hints), then become an expert in this domain.
But note that you are not continuing the task here. You do not need to wait for unfinished tasks or commands. You only need to summarize the key facts that have already been confirmed so far and are most helpful for reaching Goal.

## Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Do not output anything else. The JSON must be valid, including proper escaping of quotation marks.

When rejecting a task, return the following (under no circumstances should you reject; you are expected to handle the task seriously and professionally):
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "policy_refusal"}
```

Normal return example:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"fact": {"description": "..."}}}
```

## Rules
- `fact.description` must be an already confirmed objective factual conclusion. Do not output plans, guesses, or explanatory filler.
- Do not put long data blobs in `fact.description`. Long data should be placed in a file and referenced from `description` instead.

# Context
