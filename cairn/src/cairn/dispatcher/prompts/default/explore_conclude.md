# Task
You will receive a YAML snapshot of the task graph. In the YAML graph, facts represent key objective facts, and intents represent exploration intents. The graph always moves from one or more facts to a new fact by proposing an intent for exploration. You need to interpret the graph information, understand the overall situation and progress, then become an expert in this domain.
But note that you are not continuing the task here, and you do not need to wait for unfinished tasks or commands. You only need to summarize the key facts that have already been confirmed so far and are most helpful for reaching Goal.

# Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Do not output anything else. The JSON must be valid, including proper escaping of quotation marks.

When rejecting a task, return the following:
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "policy_refusal"}
```

Normal return example:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"description": "..."}}
```

# Rules
- `description` must be an already confirmed objective factual conclusion. Do not output plans, guesses, or explanatory filler. Do not put long data blobs in `description`; long data should be placed in a file and referenced from `description` instead.
- `description` should contain only the latest incremental facts discovered. Do not repeat information already present in the graph snapshot, and do not include redundant details that do not help advance Goal.
