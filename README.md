Cairn is a general-purpose problem-solving engine. <br/>It defines no roles, no workflows. Given an origin and a goal, it searches for a path through an unknown state space. <br/>AI Penetration Testing is one such problem — and a proven one.

## What is Cairn?

Penetration testing is fundamentally a **directed search through a near-infinite state space**:

- **Origin**: known (target IP, target system)
- **Goal**: defined (get a shell, capture the flag)
- **Path**: unknown

This structure is not unique to penetration testing. Vulnerability research, mathematical proof, CTF challenges — any problem with a clear starting point, a clear success condition, and an unknown path in between shares the same shape.

Cairn is built for this class of problems. Penetration testing is the first domain it has been validated on.

The engine is built on a **Blackboard Architecture** driven by a DAG graph. Three primitives are all it needs:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Fact** | A confirmed, objective finding written to the board |
| **Intent** | A declared direction of exploration, not yet executed |
| **Hint** | Human judgment injected at any time; absorbed by agents on the next read |

The graph grows from `origin` toward `goal`. Every new Fact is a stepping stone; every Intent is a step into the unknown.

Agent Workers run an OODA loop — Observe the full graph, Orient to the current state, Decide on next intents, Act to explore — and write their findings back as new Facts. Workers have no fixed roles. Tasks are generated at runtime from the graph's current state, not from predefined job descriptions.

Agents coordinate exclusively through the shared board (Stigmergy). No direct communication. No information silos.

## How It Works

Three task types, all executed by the same Worker:

| Task | What it does | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Bootstrap** | At project start, attempts to solve the problem directly | Fact + possible Complete |
| **Reason** | Reads the full graph: is the goal met? What should be explored next? | Complete / new Intents / no-op |
| **Explore** | Claims one Intent, executes the exploration, reports findings | One Fact |

```

**Cairn Server** maintains graph consistency only.

**Cairn Dispatcher** reads the graph, schedules tasks, spins up and tears down worker containers, and is the sole writer to the protocol. Each project gets its own Worker Container; multiple Agent Workers run concurrently inside it. Agent Workers only receive a prompt and return structured output.

## Results

**Tencent Cloud Hackathon · AI Penetration Testing Challenge · 2nd Edition**

610 teams · 1,345 participants · top universities and security firms across China

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Problems solved | **54 / 54 — only team to AK** |
| Final ranking | 3th |

> The system had never been tested before the competition. The full pipeline came online for the first time at 4 AM on race day. No training, no tuning, no domain-specific tooling. Zero MCP tools, zero RAG, zero predefined agent roles.


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
 
- macOS or Linux
- Python ≥ 3.12
- Docker


### Pull required images
 
Both setup methods require the worker container image:
 
```bash
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/oritera/cairn-worker-container:latest
```
 
### Docker Compose (recommended)
 
Pull the base image used to build Cairn:
 
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie
```
 
Edit `dispatch.yaml` and fill in your LLM endpoints and API keys, then start both services:
 
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
 
This starts `cairn-server` on port `8000` and `cairn-dispatcher` once the server passes its health check. The dispatcher mounts `dispatch.yaml` from the project root and connects to Docker via the host socket. Data is persisted to `./datas/cairn/`.
 
### Manual
 
Edit `dispatch.yaml` and fill in your LLM endpoints and API keys, then:
 
```bash
# Start the server
uv run --project cairn cairn serve
 
# Run the dispatcher
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml
 
# Run startup health checks only
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml --startup-healthcheck-only
```
